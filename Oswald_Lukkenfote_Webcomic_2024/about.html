                                assistant manager in the retail industry. Aside from some art classes at Patuxent High School and McDaniel College Mr. Oster
                                considers himself largely self-taught from studying the works of artists in the worlds of fine art, cartooning, illustration, 
                                and social media.

                        Mr. Oster firmly believes in eclecticism: the ability to synthesize influences from different aesthetics and disciplines 
                        to create something more than the sum of its parts. In his earlier days as an artist he used colored pencils for the majority of his work until
                        he decided to move away from colored pencils and use Prismacolor and Copic markers instead because of their more 
                        solid colors. In recent years however Mr. Oster decided to move use digital art programs to color his work for the foreseeable future.
