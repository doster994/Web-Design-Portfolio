        <p> The world-renowned film composer Hans Zimmer was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1957.
            He began his musical career in 1982 and his Academy Award-nominated soundtrack for the 1988 film <i>Rain Man</i> marks his first major achievement.
            His style at the time was distinguished by his utilization of both sythesizers and orchestral music.
            He won his first Academy Award, or "Oscar",for Best Original Score through the soundtrack to the original 1994 <i>Lion King</i>.
            Since then he has composed a stunning array of scores for both live-action films and animated feature films.
            Suprisingly enough, nearly forty years since he began his career, he won his second "Oscar" for the soundtrack to the 2021 SF epic <i>Dune: Part One</i>.
